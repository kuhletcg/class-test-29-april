## This repo's where I am going to write my solutions.

As you can clearly see over here Readme.md file is in the root of the repository and is automatically displayed by github below the project directory.

- Firstly I was asked to create write a React program to calculate the exponent of a number using recursion.

- Secondly, I was asked to create a React (use Hooks) project with a function that receives a number as input and inserts underscores (\_) after every two odd numbers. For example, if you get 135679 the output should be 123_45_67_89.
