## This repo's where I am going to write my solutions.

- Firstly I was asked to create write a React program to calculate the exponent of a number using recursion.

- Secondly, I was asked to create a React (use Hooks) project with a function that receives a number as input and inserts underscores (\_) after every two odd numbers. For example, if you get 135679 the output should be 123_45_67_89.
